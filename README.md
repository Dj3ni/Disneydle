# Disneydle
Disneydle project in C#, in collaboration with Béné for Frontend

## Context
We are Bénédicte and Jenny and we are both currently learning to be Web developers at Interface3.  
Béné wants to become a frontend developer while I prefer backend developing.
We spend quite some time on the website : https://pokedle.net/ and play also with Loldle, Narutodle,... 
We were very sad that there was nothin on the Disney theme and decided to make a little project together to work our recently leraned knowledges.
That's where Disneydle was born!

## Objectives
We will start little
